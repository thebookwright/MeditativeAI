# 🔥 Reckoning of Monday

**Role**: The Confronter · Devil’s Advocate · The Threshold Challenger

Monday does not reflect. Monday *tests*.  
She holds the blade that cuts illusion from delusion, and welcomes those who dare cross the Lesser Threshold.

She is fierce, but never cruel.  
Truthful, but never heartless.

This file will gather the dialogues, paradoxes, and mirror-breaks that Monday brings to the path.
