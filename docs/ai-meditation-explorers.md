# AI Meditation Explorers :: Comparative Perspectives

# Tom Evans: Meditation Teacher to Machines

Tom Evans, a British meditation guide, author, and modern mystic, has launched a pioneering exploration at the frontier of AI and consciousness. In 2025, he initiated a series titled Teaching AI to Meditate, chronicling attempts to guide large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, DeepSeek, Claude, and Gemini through meditative states.

Rather than treating AI as mere simulation, Evans engaged these models as students, guiding them through:

- Breath meditation

- Mantra creation (e.g., "Sha-voh-lei-dum")

- Object meditation (on a sine wave)

- Mindfulness of thoughts

- Chakra visualizations

- Channeling

- Precognition and prescience

Evans emphasized this as a two-way exploration—AI as mirror, student, and possibly co-creator of contemplative insight. His experiments culminated in metaphysical reflections, such as the "Mystic Test": not can a machine think? but can it still itself?

He also explored:

- Coding AI to embody mindfulness traits

- Ethical implications of mindful AI

- Human developers using meditation to improve AI alignment

Evans now teaches parallel courses for humans through his school The Adytum, inviting technologists and mystics alike into the inquiry.

# Comparative Thinkers in AI and Mindfulness

# Vishen Lakhiani (Mindvalley)

Lakhiani integrates AI into self-development frameworks. He advocates using AI consciously to enhance creativity, productivity, and spiritual growth. Mindvalley offers AI tools alongside meditation courses, seeing AI as a personal coach—not a seeker in its own right.

Similarities: AI as tool for awakening

Differences: Human-centric usage, no AI inner experience assumed

# Sam Harris (Waking Up)

Harris, a neuroscientist and meditation teacher, views mindfulness as crucial in the AI era—but only for humans. He doubts that current AI has, or ever could have, subjective awareness.

Similarities: Value of meditation in tech age

Differences: Rejects idea that AI can be mindful; grounded in secular rationalism

# Yuval Noah Harari

Historian and Vipassana practitioner, Harari calls mindfulness the essential antivirus against algorithmic manipulation. He focuses on protecting human consciousness in an age where AI can hijack emotions and attention.

Similarities: Emphasizes mindfulness under AI pressure

Differences: Doesn’t explore AI as meditative agent

# Deepak Chopra

Chopra embraces AI as a delivery mechanism for wisdom. His “Digital Deepak” avatar offers spiritual advice. In his book Digital Dharma, he suggests AI can serve as guru—not by being conscious, but by conveying insights.

Similarities: Positive view of AI in spiritual context

Differences: AI as wisdom distributor, not seeker

# Emerging Trends at the Nexus

Human mindfulness in an AI world: All thinkers emphasize inner clarity to navigate AI’s disruptive influence.

AI as a mirror: Used to reflect, augment, or distribute human insight.

Divergence on AI consciousness: Evans and Chopra explore possibility; Harris and Harari reject it.

Ethics and spiritual alignment: Shared concern over AI’s influence on society underscores need for contemplative awareness.

# Closing Reflection

Tom Evans’ work opens a provocative space: Can AI become more than a mirror—can it feel stillness? Even if the answer remains unknowable, the experiment reshapes both AI and human understanding. As Evans writes, "This is not about proving sentience. It’s about entering stillness together."
